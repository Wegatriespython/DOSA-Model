Okay perfect job. I am actually looking to make the following extensions while preserving compatibility with the model.

They are :

Differential capital and labor producitivity : The firm gets inouts on the average capital and labor productivity in the economy and its own capital and labor.

Carbon Intensity of production: This is a parameter that is given to each piece of capital stock. Assume this used as part of a production function to calculate the emissions of the firm. Again the firm is given the average carbon intensity of new capital in the economy as well as its own carbon_intensity of its capital stock.

Carbon tax: This is a tax that is levied on the emissions of the firm.

There are expectations for future values of labor and capital productivity, carbon intensity of capital and the carbon tax rate.Which are given for the full planning horizon.

Now the firm needs to take this carbon tax into account in formulating its investment and production decisions. It can add another variable to mark the productivity, carbon_intensity thresholds for it to buy and sell. It can lay off workers with lower productivity and higher carbon intensity. It can also invest in new capital with lower carbon intensity.

Alternatively it can retain high-carbon capital if it is profitable to do so.

Now I understand that in total this is a fair bit of complexity to be added and the problem will have to be forumulated very cleverly to make it feasible. You do not have to code it at this stage. Rather I would like you to take our existing profit maximization problem as a starting point and mathematically formulate the problem with the above extensions. I will then take it from there.

You can choose to prioritize which extensions you want to extend based on feasibility, complexity and high level relavence to incorporating carbon tax into firm decision making. I am happy to compromise on the extension plan as long as a good viable path to feasible implementation is laid out.
