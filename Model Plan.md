## Introduction

This document outlines a comprehensive plan to extend the K+S (Keynes meets Schumpeter) Labor Extended model. The goal is to incorporate climate policy elements and enhance the representation of economic insecurity within the model framework. This extension aims to explore the complex interactions between climate policies, firm innovation decisions, labor market dynamics, and worker economic security.

Research Question : What are the dynamics between climate policy and economic insecurity in the labor market 

## Base Model

The starting point is the K+S Labor Extended model, chosen for its:
- Endogenous innovation module with imitation and innovation driven by a 2-stage Bernoulli trial
- Detailed labor market component

## Key Extensions

### 1. Enhanced Labor Market Competition

- Individualized wage offers based on worker skills
- Strategic hiring process:
  - Firms observe worker skill levels
  - Labor demand calculated based on production requirements and worker productivity
  - Applicants sorted by skill level in descending order
  - Wage offers optimized based on firm budget and worker productivity
- Skill-based firing decisions:
  - Firms adjust non-contractually protected labor force
  - Attempt to retain higher-performing workers within production requirements

### 2. Dual Innovation Types

- Carbon intensity reducing innovations (A_C^τ, B_C^τ)
- Productivity enhancing innovations (A^τ, B^τ)
- Spillover effects between carbon and productivity innovations

### 3. Carbon Policies

- Carbon taxes:
  - Levied on firms based on carbon emissions
  - Tax rate ρ^C applied to quantity of carbon produced
- Carbon subsidies:
  - Awarded to firms that successfully innovate or imitate carbon-reducing technologies
  - Selection process based on market share and innovation success
  - Two subsidy models: Proportional and Flat

### 4. Carbon Emissions

- Technology vintages have both productivity (A^τ, B^τ) and carbon intensity (A_C^τ, B_C^τ) ratings
- Firms emit carbon based on production quantity multiplied by carbon intensity

### 5. Endogenized Firm Capital Allocation

- Firms optimize capital allocation based on profit expectations
- Investment decisions split between:
  - Productivity enhancement (RD)
  - Carbon reduction (RD^C)
- Investment choices influenced by:
  - Expectations of carbon taxes
  - Potential profit gains
  - Subsidy availability

### 6. Enhanced Government Role

- More complex modeling to handle carbon policies
- Decision-making process for:
  - Awarding subsidies (based on firm innovation success and market share)
  - Setting carbon tax rates
- Imperfect knowledge of capital goods firms, leading to stochastic selection for subsidies

### 7. Worker Skill Dynamics

- Baseline skill level for new workers
- Skill progression through learning-by-doing when employed
- Skill deterioration when unemployed
- Potential for divergent skill trajectories based on firm innovation focus (carbon vs. regular)
- Skill distance calculation for worker-firm matching

### 8. Strategic Contracts

- Firms offer job contracts for fixed periods to top-performing workers
- Contracted workers receive wage increases and job security
- Contracts terminated if firm goes bankrupt

### 9. Economic Insecurity Measures

- Incorporating factors such as:
  - Job stability (contract duration, employment history)
  - Wage levels and growth
  - Skill development opportunities

## Proposed Future Developments

1. Further refinement of the government's role in policy-making
2. Potential expansion of economic insecurity metrics
3. Possible inclusion of more sophisticated worker savings behavior
4. Optimize model for performance
